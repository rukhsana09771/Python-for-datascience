# 3. Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle and compute the area.

height = eval(input("Enter the height of the triangle:"))
base = eval(input("Enter the base of the triangle:"))
area_of_the_triangle = (height*base)/2
print("Area of the triangle is:",area_of_the_triangle)
